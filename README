What would it be if RSpec were originally written in Java?

I think that would be like this...

Given I have a class called User and I want to write its specification in Java, so I write:

describe( User.class );
add( new Spec( "it should have a name" ) {
	public void doIt() {
		User user = new User();
		user.name = "Diogo";

		should( user.name.equals( "Diogo" ) );
	}
} );

The code above should produce something like this: 

User specifications:
	it should have a name... ok!
